# E-Commerce and Retail B2B Case Study

# Problem Statement

Schuster, a multinational retailer of sports goods and accessories, conducts extensive business with numerous vendors under credit arrangements. However, some vendors delay payments, leading Schuster to impose late fees, which are not conducive to long-term partnerships. Currently, employees spend significant time following up on payments, resulting in non-value-added activities, time loss, and financial impact. Schuster aims to analyze customer payment behavior to predict late payments on open invoices.


# Objective
1. Schuster aims to better understand customer payment behavior through past payment patterns (customer segmentation).
2. Using historical data, it seeks to predict the likelihood of delayed payments on open invoices.
3. This information will help collectors prioritize follow-ups to ensure timely payments
